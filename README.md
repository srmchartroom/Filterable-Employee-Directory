## Description

React-based Filterable Employee Directory. The application leaverages `node.js`, `ReactJS` and standard ES6 `JavaScript`. Based on the powerful ReactJS framework this uses the inherent OOP with the "V"-focused MVC to create a fast filterable, sortable, and searchable employee directory with consumable data based on API (sample employees derived from the random.me API).

## Tests

Be sure to test the application after installation and deploying it. Jest-based automated tests were inherent in the React-basis of this particular project, but final deploy and render should be ultimately the basis for testing and successful evaluation of the application on your environment - local or otherwise.  Code formatting has been standardized and successful execution can be quickly confirmed by simply running the application. To complete this, follow the installation instructions above. Additional context and instruction can be reviewed in the video provided above under [usage](#usage).
